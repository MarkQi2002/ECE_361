Design Specification

We implemented multiple sessions and private messaging functionalities and below are the procedures regarding how we implemented the functionalities.

Functionality 1, Multiple Sessions
On server side, we implemented linked list structure for recording all sessions a user joined and all users within certain session.
On client side, we implemented linked list structure for recording all sessions the user joined and indicate user sessions joined everytime a user join or leave session.
On both side, we removed limitation of a user only capable of joined one single session.

Functionality 2, Private messaging
We implemented three new types of message.
Type 13 -> Private Message From Source To Server
Format /dm "<user to private message to>" "<message to send>"

Type 14 -> Delivering Private Message To Receiver From Server
Format message.source (Sent By Which User) message.data (Message)

Type 15 -> Delivering Private Message Error To Sender From Server
Format message.data (Error Detail)

The private messaging functionality is implemented similar to normal message.
